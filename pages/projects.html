                 it changes from a ton of columns to 1 one column. Would be
                 better if they gradually reducded to fewer columns,

              The internal website for students and staff members at Denison
              University, that displays various information, such as announcements,
              campus events, student jobs, account balances, grades and so much
              more. I worked on making the website responsive, converting it to
              a new version of a CMS, and created and modified web apps for it.

              A multiplatform program used to take programming exams on students'
              own laptops, but has numerous measures to prevent cheating: it
              forces fullscreen mode and prevents minimization, alt-tabbing,
              or viewing any other application until you click to finish the exam,
              among many other measures. I fixed errors related to the internal
              Python shell students use to answer questions, implemented
              plagiarism verification, and worked on the exam correction mode.

              A Java application that verifies if the connection to an internal
              or external drive (HDD, SSD, USB, etc.) is very stable or not.
              While there are numerous disk health check programs available for
              free that are quite good at detecting the health of storage
              devices, they unfortunately do not account for bad connections.
              For example: you can have a HDD that is in perfect condition, but
              it randomly disconnects periodically due to a bad SATA cable, USB
              cable, bad port, or just because the cable needs reseated.
